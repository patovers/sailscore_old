Sailscore is a simple app for running a sailing race series.\n\n
Navigation through the app is via lists of competitors, race series and results.
Use the device\'s \"Back\" button to navigate back through the screens.\n\n
Start by entering your competitors - touch \"Enter New Competitor 
Details\" on the home screen or \"View/Edit Existing Competitors\" then Menu > 
Create New Competitor.\n
Touch \"Save and next\" until they are all entered and then
 \"Save and quit for the last one.\n
If you miss any you can come back and enter them later.\n\n
Create a race series - touch \"Create New Race Series\" (or 
\"View/Edit Existing Race Series\" and then 
Menu > Create Series).\n
Enter the basics for the series. For discard profile enter 
e.g. 0#0#1 for  a series of 3 races where one discard is 
allowed after 3 races sailed or 0#0#1#1#2 if 2 discards are allowed 
after 5 races sailed.
You must enter the details before adding competitors to the series.\n
Touch \"Select Competitors\" and check those you want in the series. 
Touch \"Confirm Selections\" when done.\n\n
When displaying all series, touch one to use it.\n
A tabbed view appears; touch the tab for the way you want to enter 
your results.\n
A list of competitors or a list of races will be shown.\n
Enter results by typing finishing positions, times, or 
pulling down the list to select a result code. Touch Save Results 
when done.\n\n
When you\'ve entered all the results touch Menu > Score Series to 
display the overall positions, points and individual race results.\n
The menu button also give access to changing series information, such as 
adding/deleting races or adding/removing competitors.\n
Menu > Export Series will create a .csv file and show a dialogue 
to choose what to do with it.\n
The file can be imported into SailWave or other applications such as Excel.
If export is done before scoring then the raw data is exported, 
otherwise fully scored data with rankings is exported.\n\n
Notes:\n\n
If a competitor is deleted from the global list it is also removed 
from any series in which it is used - Take Care when doing this!\n
If a competitor is removed from a series it remains in the database
for use in other series. Other series in which it already appears 
are not affected. \n\n
If you need to add a fresh competitor to an existing series you
need to return to the home screen and add the competitor in the
usual way then return to the series to add them using the
\"Select Competitors\" button. You will then be able to add 
their results.\n\n
If you change the number of races in a series, new ones are added to the 
end and removed ones are deleted from the last race and work backwards. Results
that have been entered for races that are then deleted are lost. 
You can add a race back on but results for it will need re-entering.\n\n
Checking entered finish places is only done when scoring.
e.g. If you enter a 1st, 2nd and 4th place with no 3rd, the 4th place finisher
will receive 3 points when scored but will still show 4th as a finish position.\n
The app will correctly allocate points for tied places, count backs and the various redress
and scoring penalty situations.\n\n\n
